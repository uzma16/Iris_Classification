# Iris Classification

Our Iris Data Classification project employs machine learning (Logistic Regression)techniques to accurately classify iris flowers into distinct species based on features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The model, trained on the well-known Iris dataset, showcases the capability of our system to perform binary-class classification with high accuracy.

## Algorithm

Logistic Regression is used here to classify the category of flowers.

## Frontend

For Frontend, I've used streamlit library in order to interact with the algorithm.

## How to Run?

- Clone the repository
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- streamlit run application.py
